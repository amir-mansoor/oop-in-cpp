Programming have three pillars

- Data Storage
- Iteration
- Decisions

## Data Types

We have seen some data types in lecture 1 in lecture we seen char and bool.
For bool we can use true and false but in cpp most people use 0 and 1. 0 for false and everything else is true.

## Decisions

we have pratice if elseif and else etc. also we have seen switch but our teacher didn't recommend it to use
